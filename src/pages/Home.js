                    I'm currently looking for new opportunities to develop my skills!

                    <p>During my Master's degree, my work was mainly focused on the Human-Computer Interaction area. We were studying the use of videogames as a complement to traditional therapy using off-the-shelf controllers like the Wii Balance Board
                    and a Dance Mat, and managed to publish a research paper with part of that work. I'm a tech and science enthusiast, with a particular interest in front-end and mobile development, but open to discovering new passions.</p>
                
                    <p>Beyond the digital realm, I enjoy scuba diving, 3D printing, photography, and exploring the wonders of space and nature through documentaries.
                    With a collaborative mindset and an eagerness to learn, I like to feel part of a team where we can build cool stuff together.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: My face went on one of the last Space Shuttle flights and my name has gone as far as Mars on other community events for NASA missions.</p>
